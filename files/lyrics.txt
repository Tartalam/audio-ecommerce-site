Intro
Woman I love you yes I do, anything for you

Verse

when I think of the things that are so wonderful
so beautiful to me
when I think of the world that surrounds me
and the beautiful women within
they sometime let me feel like I wanna do something
more than good to you
guess if I could sure i would
to prove that i believe in you

Chorus

Sometimes i feel like i want to reach out break through
take your heart away in turn replace it with mine
love it is true truly i believe in you oh girl

Verse

i guess every man sometimes wish
that somewhere in their life
an angel will come to grant his wish
let him know what happiness is
I dont need no one to grant me that wish
for shes right here with me
given that that i must
an i love the way it makes me feel

no booze, cocaine
no da gone thing
will ever change or bring you pain
love it is true
truly i do believe in you

Bridge

your love is like a quick sand
i would gladly sink into you
with no fear or wanting to know
what would happen to me
for my love you are my reason
why am happy today
and i would do anything to keep it that way

Chorus

sometimes i feel like i want to
reach out and breakthrough
take your heart away
in turn replace it with mine
love it is true
truly i do believe in you
